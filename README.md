# course_grader

Write a course_grader function that takes a **list** of test scores as its *parameter*.

It will add up these test scores and calculate an average score.

It should then **return** a message of "pass" or "fail" depending on these two conditions:

>1. If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and no single test score is below 50, then return a message of "pass".
>2. If the average score is lower than 70 or at least one test score is below 50, then return a message of "fail".
